        <h6>My future Goals & Philosophy. </h6>
        <p>One thing i have learned with my experience is that there are two types of things in this world one is dual, imparmanent, perishable and the other is truth, eternal.
        Apart from physical things human also needs other things like  desires, knowledge to survive.
